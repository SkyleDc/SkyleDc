<strong>Ahem ...</strong>

Hello ! I'm Skyle. Or SkyleDc. Or anything you'd call me.<br>
I'm a french student in computer science and also a developer.

I love High-Tech. Seriously, this is the most interesting thing in the world. I love new technologies.

Iâ€™m currently trying to learn Electron (even if there's not so much to learn).<br>
<strong>I'm discovering new technologies everyday.</strong><br>
I'm also learning how to use Unreal Engine 4 to create games.<br>
Python is on my "Languages I'd like to learn more because it's so cool and efficient" list.<br>
<strong>Did I tell you how much I love new technologies ?</strong><br>
Beside languages, i'm trying to learn AI to include them in my future games and projects.<br>
<strong>AI is part of new technologies.</strong><br>

Languages I already know :
  - C++
  - Python basics
  - HTML/CSS
  - Javascript
  - SQL
  - Unreal Engine 4 Blueprint language
