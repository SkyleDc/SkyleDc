<h1>Hey !</h1>

I'm Skyle. Or SkyleDc. Or anything you'd call me.<br>
I'm a (beginner) developer.

I love High-Tech and new technologies.

Iâ€™m currently learning React.js.<br>
I'm also learning how to use Unreal Engine 4/5 to create games.<br>
Beside languages, i'm trying to learn AI to include them in my future games and projects.<br>

Languages I already know :
  - C/C++ basics
  - Python
  - HTML
  - CSS basics, I do not like CSS, I'm not creative
  - Javascript
  - PHP
  - SQL
  - Unreal Engine 4 Blueprint language
  - Lua basics
