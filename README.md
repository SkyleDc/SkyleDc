Hello ! I'm Skyle. Or SkyleDc. Or anything you'd call me.
I'm a french student in computer science and I am a developer.

I love High-Tech. Seriously, this is the most interesting thing in the world. I love new technologies.
Glory to internet.

Iâ€™m currently trying to learn Electron (even if there's not so much to learn).
I'm also learning how to use Unreal Engine 4 to create games.
Python is on my "Languages I'd like to learn more because it's so cool and efficient" list.
Beside languages, i'm trying to learn AI to include them in my future games and projects.

Languages I already know :
  - C++
  - Python basics
  - HTML/CSS
  - Javascript
  - SQL
  - Unreal Engine 4 Blueprint language
